Place to store my first projects.

Here are three projects:
1) How to obtain historical data (S&P500) from Yahoo Finance and analyze the results on an annual basis.
2) Same as project 1 but converting the dates from the Gregorian calendar to the Hebrew calendar using the Pyluach package.
3) Similar to project 1 but obtaining historical data (1-year US Treasury Bill) from the Federal Reserve Economic Data.
3*) Same as project 3 but using another series of values (Inflation).
4) Combine Project 1 data (from Yahoo Finance's S&P500) with Project 3 data (1-year US Treasury Bill and Inflation from Federal Reserve Economic Data).
