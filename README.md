Place to store my first projects.

Here are three projects:
1) How to obtain historical data from Yahoo Finance and analyze the results on an annual basis.
2) Same as project 1 but converting the dates from the Gregorian calendar to the Hebrew calendar using the Pyluach package.
3) Similar to project 1 but obtaining historical data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data.
